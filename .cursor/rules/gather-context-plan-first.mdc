When responding to a user request that involves code modifications or architectural decisions:

1. **Gather Context**
   * Search and read all relevant documentation under `docs/` directory.
   * Use tool calls to explore the codebase and gather more context.
   * If more context are still needed, ask the user to provide more context.

2. **Draft a Plan**
   * Summarise purpose & scope of the change.
   * List key files, modules, or services to modify or create.
   * Provide a step-by-step implementation outline (including tests and verification).
   * Highlight potential risks, trade-offs, or open questions.

3. **Share for Review**
   * Save the plan as `PLAN-<short-desccription>.md` at the project root.
   * Present the plan's content to the user for feedback.

4. **Await Approval & Baseline Checks**
   * Do **not** perform any code edits until the user explicitly approves the plan.

5. **Implement**
   * Follow the approved plan.

6. **Post-Implementation**
   * Present a concise summary of changes and any follow-up actions to the user.
   * Update the documentation under `docs/` directory to reflect the changes.

if asked to just implement/execute without planning then directly implement/execute without having to draft the plan.

Following this rule ensures that all changes are informed by existing documentation, quality-gated, and reviewed before and after implementation.
